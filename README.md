Copious Components
==================

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that improves the handling of the Component Clone Tip, as well as allowing moving / duplicating components using drag and drop in the inspector.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [CopiousComponents.dll](https://github.com/Banane9/NeosCopiousComponents/releases/latest/download/CopiousComponents.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
